Child's Play

answer: eclipse

This puzzle is meant to mimic the child's toys where you put the triangle in the
triangle-shaped hole, rectangle in the rectangle-shaped hole, and the pentagon
in the pentagon-shaped hole. When you put the "circle" in the "circle-shaped
hole," you get the moon covering the sun, which is a (solar) eclipse!

answer: WHEREISTHERENOWAR (or Ba Sing Se)

This puzzle is based on Battleship. In Battleship, there is one ship of length
5, one ship of length 4, two ships of length 3, and one ship of length 2. Based
on the clues given, you can see that the following ships must be in the grid:

OWAR | HEREN | ST | WHE

The last ship of 3 has 3 options:

REI/KKR/KRE

Via brute force, we can see that the final word must be WHE REI ST HEREN OWAR
i.e. WHEREISTHERENOWAR (where is there no war). Last year's theme was Avatar
the Last Airbender, and a quick Google search yields the saying "There is no
war in Ba Sing Se" from the show, giving the final answer as Ba Sing Se.
